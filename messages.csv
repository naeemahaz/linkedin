Fruit Street delivers telemedicine services such as urgent care, behavioral health, diabetes prevention, diabetes management, hypertension management, and virtual primary care.  We are currently recruiting advisors for our company. One of the company’s benefits we offer to advisors is that they have the opportunity to invest, and many do so via their IRA/401K. This is not required to be on the advisory board, but it is simply a corporate benefit we offer.  Here is our pitch deck, which provides an excellent summary of our company for potential advisory board members: https://www.clearslide.com/view/mail?iID=xtRXM9cSQWQN7tFS8hwb.  You can also connect with our CEO on LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/girardlaurence/. Here are a couple of media interviews Laurence Girard just did: https://bit.ly/3tL9AbY and https://bit.ly/3fdHKA0  This nicely summarizes our company’s history: https://medcitynews.com/2020/06/cultivated-by-physician-investors-fruit-street-healths-evolution-as-a-telehealth-business/.  To learn more about our diabetes prevention program that has Full CDC Recognition, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTujudQ_-zE&t=0s  This is a video about the virtual primary care product we are launching: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ezqn6wyhbtp0zk/zoom_2.mp4?dl=0  Our company is overgrowing, and we are projecting to do between $6-$8 million in revenue this year.

I am an advocate pushing for the representation of BIPOC talent both in front and behind the camera. I am currently in pre-production on a short film that resonates with Black Lives Matter, Meetoo movement and LGBTQ rights.  I am mentored by Oscar Nominee, the acclaimed Director, Atom Egoyan.  Perhaps you know someone who could help spread word about our film.  We are in need of the remaining 10% of our budget.  Please view our campaign to see if it resonates with you. This is a short, prequel to a TV series and currently supported by Toronto Arts Council, Ontario Arts Council and Canada Arts Council.

Some of us want to reach more prospects; maybe ask some questions of a group; and raise our network visibility.

United States- these a country of close to 400 million people with a single state bigger than Nigeria in lands, which means the country can produce more than enough organic food to feed the people, which will create an affordable produce and fruits for all instead of the kind of food and fruits that currently made the immune systems of average Americans so bad that it couldn’t withstand any virus attacks... therefore, any economy that doesn’t do enough to strengthen the immunity of his population will always fall a victim, that is one lesson from COVID-19.  Secondly, this point can also be linked to the above, any economy that is termed prosperous must provide a good affordable healthcare system to take care of the citizens, for me a healthy and strong citizens is a healthy and prosperous economy.  Economy; I will discuss this from few areas:  Education- for United States to lift the citizens above poverty line, there must be rigorous educational programs to educate and reorientate many citizens on values they need to embrace, opportunities they need to see across the country and sacrifices that has to be paid.  That been said, the people should be trained on the skills needed to build the economy instead of depending on shipping services jobs (IT and Manufacturing) overseas, especially with many wfh jobs which COVID-19 had enabled, it means many of these jobs can be done in United States at some lower rate working from home.  Technology; I see technology as an enabler, which helps business owners to get their jobs done quicker and easier. I have a personal idea of business solutions which am working on to see how different small business can spend little to manage their business as an SME such that it reduces technology expense, such as ERP, supply chain, and e-commerce with accounting, taxation, and integrated payment systems.   Thus eliminating dependence on third party software or the expensive enterprise technologies.This solution has to be cost saving, scalable, secure and efficient.  The above on technology is an idea am very passionate about and it’s one critical way to enable SME (which includes schools and healthcare family) which accounts for more than 80% jobs in US and other countries around the world, with such a prosperous economy can be created.  Lastly, we need to raise leaders and not just capitalist that focus on making more money more than lifting people! With enough true leaders that are passionate about people, the nation, leaders that love to have peace and harmony that are sustainable in a prosperous economy. And we need them in business and politics.  Thanks,  Kennedy A. Alade",INBOX

This is how I have lost 80 pounds and kept it off.  I coach successful women who want to lose or maintain weight and keep it off forever. I also help women start to love their bodies and keep commitments to themselves. We as women are great at keeping all our commitments to others but we break them with ourselves all the time.  I have found the secret and I love sharing it with women. I share my story on my website if you are interested. If you want to check it out, go to bflycoaching.com/free-course for a free course where I teach 3 simple tools to help women lose weight and begin to love their bodies.  Please also like my page on Facebook. I share motivational tools and tips on losing weight, dealing with our primitive brain, and learning to stop the war with ourselves when it comes to how we look. Facebook.com/bflycoaching  Feel free to pass this along to any women you know.  Wishing you all the best, Shannan",INBOX

I was wondering if you are taking on new clients.     I do have a referral from Robaire W. Estel.  He is the writer of ""True Blood"" and ""Meteor Man "".  His number is 310-625-7377.  Also,  he is on Linkedin.    It will be a honor to work with you because I see from you profile, you are a fun guy.    Please, I am asking you to take a chance on me.  I may not be the new ""IT"" girl, but I am smart, I work hard, I listen and I force myself to be the best.    I believe in giving back to the community and being a better human being.    I hosted a podcast called ""Lesbian Life"".  I had sponsors and the show was downloaded  through ITunes as one of the best Lesbian podcast.   The podcast started when my first girlfriend cheated on me and she also realize she didn't like black people.  We were dating for 6 months.  She saw me almost everyday.   My number is 520-405-2724 and my email is naeemahaz@gmail.com.   You can call me anytime.    Again, it would be a honor to work with you.    Thank you for your time.",INBOX

Kim Davis is a Rowan County clerk in Kentucky who has repeatedly refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court declared that same-sex couples have the right to marry. She believes the law is ungodly and immoral.  Jesus Christ was a perfect man who never sinned and became a martyr for the Christian movement.     Kim Davis has been married four times to three different men. The first three marriages ended in divorce in 1994, 2006 and 2008.  She is the mother of twins, who were born five months after her divorce from her first husband.  Her third husband is the biological father of the twins. Her second husband adopted the twins. Kim is currently married to her fourth husband.  Her fourth husband and his family introduced the Apostolic Christian faith in 2011.      She went was arrested and went to jail by refusing to issue marriage licenses.  Currently, she is out, but the court has warned to not interfere with issuing marriage licenses.  She has decided that her employees can issue marriage licenses but she will not put her stamp of approval.      Currently, the federal appeals court denied her request to be exempted from a gubernatorial directive to comply with the Supreme Court’s June decision on same-sex marriage.  In a short order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit noted that ""Davis has not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on her federal constitutional claims.""    This dispute -- which is separate from Davis' legal challenge to an August court order instructing Davis to issue marriage licenses to gay couples -- stems from a countersuit she filed against Gov. Steve Beshear (D), whom she has argued is partly responsible for her present court troubles.    These legal maneuverings all stem from the original lawsuit a group of gay and straight couples filed against Davis as a result of a blanket ""no marriage licenses"" policy she instituted following the Supreme Court ruling that established a constitutional right to marry for same-sex couples.    The Kim Davis controversy is not new.  Today, Americans are trying to forget the most ridiculous issue in American history.  What was it? Interracial marriage. Yes, couples of one man and one woman could not get married if they came from different races.  The Loving family (true family in the 60’s) - a White man and Black woman were arrested and told their marriage was illegal. Why? Because it was a sin against God and the bible.  Interracial marriages became legal in the year of 1967; which was 48 years ago.  In 2006, Alabama was the last state to allow interracial marriages between one man and one woman.   ",INBOX

The purpose of this discussion is to see if Softeligent's SaaS Telecom Expense Management solution would be good fit for Magellan Health.  Up front I want to let you know there is no capital investment required. We can operate in your existing budget. We offer a free trial and free analysis to determine your ROI. We earned business from Cigna, COX, SRP, Maricopa County, City of Los Angeles and many more. All of these enterprises experienced business process improvements through invoice automation that saved them money with complete visibility over their entire enterprise. We have competed against Tangoe and won both times. We can customize the solution to your needs and we are 40% less expensive than the competition.   Let me know if you have time next week for a 30 minute webinar presentation and discussion. I would like to invite my executive team as well to join in the discussion. Thanks again Naeemah for your consideration. If you are not the person I want to speak with please point me in the right direction.   Kind Regards, Joe Pelzel 602-717-7827",INBOX

And in turn, I want to tell you a little bit more about me and see if I can be of assistance to you.      I have over 20 years in the corporate and consulting arena with 6 years of that as a Vice President/Senior Consultant for a boutique consulting firm.  I have extensive knowledge and experience in how to grow a business, teams, client service delivery, leadership skills and overall revenue.      Today, I help small business owners grow their revenues while helping them identify potential money drains in their business and teach them how to convert these drains into faucets.  This not only helps prevent lost revenue, it also helps them grow their revenues.  My goal is to support small business owners in doubling or in some cases even tripling their revenue, through systems, strategy and accountability.  As a result of our work together they have a customized executable plan, improved efficiency, and the ability to grow revenues without jeopardizing quality of services delivered or quality of life.    In essence I become another set of eyes and a sounding board for the operations of their business, so the owners can focus on their area of expertise as the visionaries of the business.    It is possible to Serve More. Earn More.  Enjoy More. and it is my passion to show business owners how!    For a limited time, I am offering a COMPLIMENTARY strategy session for us to discuss your current challenges, see if I may be of support and if we have a good synergy.

She may never dance again, professionally. She’s resorted to getting by as a sex worker, and the life style and the long wait for some sign of recovery is getting her down. Very down.    The next time she sees the boy, he’s jumping on the old trampoline in the garden left behind by previous tenants. They get talking and she discovers he has his burdens too–an absent father and an alcoholic, violent-tempered mother...     So there you have the opening few minutes of my next film, The Stray, a short film featuring the superb actress Silvia Petkova and my son Jay Penrake. From what I’ve seen in rehearsals they have on-screen chemistry and star quality. Take a look at them here:    http://igg.me/at/the-stray     We are now running a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo and would love to see you, as a Linkedin ‘connection’, get involved, in whatever way you feel you can.     You may know me well, or barely at all – this short film project now presents itself as an opportunity for us to get to know each other a little better, or catch up, if you will. It’s amazing the good things that come from sharing a little generosity through Linkedin.   My team and I believe The Stray will be a simple, yet deeply affecting short film that you can be proud of seeing your name on.      So thanks for reading this email and, for those of you who take the time to click on the link, thanks in advance for doing that.     This is for all the strays out there, looking for love, looking for a true home.

This is what another director has said about it - and he's in the competition: 'Great in every way - excellently shot, top cast, direction editing, the lot.  Should be up at the top.'   This is an excellent short for anyone to make, pretty  exceptional for a 16-year-old. Please watch and vote.

It is an excellent guide to understand what your best route will be.  On a side note I charge per page.  30 dollars / page for very light editing and 70 dollars / page for structural editing, If your work is extremely rough it may need more than editing.    1. Length of the work:  Proper editing takes time. The more words in the piece you’d like edited, the more time it’s going to take to edit, and the more it’s going to cost. Another consideration here is how much work your writing needs: the rougher your work, the more time it’s going to take an editor to clean it up, so to speak. It’s a good idea to edit your own work a few times (or more!) before you seek out an editor to save yourself some money.  2. Level of edit required:  There are several different degrees of editing, from a proofread for typos and formatting errors to a substantive edit to repair structural issues. The Editor’s Association of Canada has a great list of the types or levels of editing. More involved levels of editing (like a substantive edit) are going to take an editor more time, and will therefore be more expensive.  3. Deadline:  How soon do you need your work edited? If your turn-around time is short, an editor may need to charge more for your project.   How Much Does Editing Cost?: The Not-So-Secret Formula  If you’d like to get a high level view of how much your next project might cost, you can do a rough calculation using the information below. A big warning here: every editor I know prices differently. There are many intangible factors when it comes to quoting on an editing project, from how many other projects you have your plate to how much overhead you have for your business. The information below is just a guideline — if an editor gives you a quote that doesn’t fit the guide below, it could still be a great price. If you ever doubt that you’re getting a good price you can always ask for referrals, or get a quote from another editor.  Here is a very high level formula that editors might use to calculate how much a project will cost.  Many editors calculate the cost of an editing project by using a variation this formula:  Pages/hour x charge per hour = total cost  The number of pages an editor will be able to complete in an hour depends on the level of edit required. For a standard guide on how much an editor might charge per hour based on the level of edit, see the rates on the Editorial Freelancers Associations site. The more involved the edit, the fewer pages an editor can complete per hour, and the more your project will cost.  Depending on their level of experience and the level of edit required, an editor may charge anywhere from $15/hour to $100+/hour.  A side note about the level of edit required: I have found the level of edit required can occasionally be a touchy subject with writers. You may only want our work proofread, but if there are bigger issues with your writing, it might be very difficult (or impossible) for an editor to only proofread your work without fixing some deeper issues (e.g. poor grammar habits). A good editor will let you know what your project needs, and occasionally, refuse your project if they feel they can’t complete the level of edit required within the budget you are looking to meet.

The app is the ""Thing of the Future"", as a new and accepted technology, just like at the beginning when the Internet was "" new""  and everyone needed a Website.     2. Now with Smartphones becoming an integral part of our lives, businesses need apps as well,   ""To get inside people's pockets"".      3. The apps which we create do not simply display the Website.      4. There are features which allow potential clients to get in touch with ease - the "" Touch to Call"" feature and "" Touch to e-mail"" Buttons in the Contact page, as well as the "" One Touch "" Contact Save Button in the Top right corner of the ""Contact Page"".      This page, along with the ""About Us"" and the ""Gallery"" page work completely offline - so that is a big difference when we compare app features with Website features.     5. We can add an offline Audio Playlist as well, in case a client needs it to play MP3 files, like Motivational Speeches, Therapies, Music, etc.      6. We can attach a PDF file which can be a Book, an Ad, a Coupon, a Restaurant Menu, you name it.      7. As for the Online Features - the Map feature will allow the users to use the app as navigation to the client's office.      8. We can also make the app to ""stream"" a ""Podcast"", or a Radio Station which must be hosted on ""SHOUTcast"" or ""Icecast"" .

My knowledge of film and data analysis, as well as negotiation and social media skills, will be an excellent addition to your company.  I have knowledge of a data analysis tool called Xceleius, which create spreadsheets into interactive data for the viewer.  I have knowledge in producing indie and web shows.  I have also produced and directed anime web shows and commercials.   Currently, Robaire W. Estel, who is a motion picture producer and scriptwriter for top rated shows and films, is mentoring me.  He has been a great asset in fulfilling my career in film and television.   Personally, I have written published books and produced a nominated webshow.  My knowledge consists of:  ·         Analytical and problem solving skills ·         Knowledge of statistics ·         Coordinates communications between team and external stakeholders ·         Strong investigation and negotiation skills ·         Time management and organizational skills ·         Script writing and editing ·         Directing ·         Creating budgets for film and television ·         Line producing ·         Script supervision ·         Social media marketing ·         Graphic designing ·         Animation ·         Leadership    I am willing to travel and/or relocate.  In Arizona, I was hired to perform analysis in the mental health sector, to improve the care, and to provide additional resources for patients with a limited budget.  I did accomplish all my goals, above satisfaction and my company sent me to Missouri with a promotion and bonus to perform the same functions.  My passion is to work in film and television and I have several ideas I would like to discuss with you, in terms with television and web projects and data analysis.   I have sent you an email with my resume and examples of my work.    If I can perform excellence at Magellan Health Services, think about the want I can do for your company.

While we are creating the project from multiple locations each doing their specific function we would film it, creating a reality show about the creative process of film making.  Once we have so many episodes ready, we take it to the airways.  My company would purchase airtime in different markets, then sell airtime, and product placement with the monies being split between the artist. I don't know if your schedule will permit but I have a pretty extensive network of people that we can work with plus to start we would just air in L.A. and St. Louis and branch out from there potentially distributing in 26 different states.  If your in we can work on the details  but for right now I am recruiting the players.  If you have any questions don't hesitate.  Namaste Adam",INBOX

We act outside our normal personalities to become fantasies for people to make money. The media is the street; your managers, agents, and publicist are your pimps or madams; and the jons are the media and people who will do anything to become like us. Our world in the spotlight is a legal sex business. You, Philip, Peter, and I are prostitutes. We advertise our bodies and attitudes for money. When we come home at the end of the day, we try to act out our true lives, even if we don't know what they are"".  Living in the spotlight, is like having multiple personality disorder. You become different people to millions of fans, but unfortunately unlike the disorder, you forget who you are in private.  Looking at yourself in the mirror, you see a hollow empty shell and your skin is the color of green. This is the price for fame and everyone wants it, they crave it, they would even die for it.  What would you do to get famous?  Lie, cheat, kill, add a third breast, or marry a movie star?  Gigi Meekins is an unknown scriptwriter who is trying to make it big, but she works as a computer programmer during the day. With her new book, ""New York Minute"", landing on the New York Times best sellers list, she has her toe on the red carpet but she wants more.  She needs to prove to her family that she has a purpose in life.  She is willing to do anything to be in the spotlight, even selling her soul to the devil.  With ""New York Minute"" turning into a film, she is introduced to three successful actors who have their own anxieties in life. Young British actor Carey Roland is desperate for the lead in the film ""New York Minute"", even though he knows; he can't pull off a New York accent. With his lack of confident in his acting abilities and a dark deep secret, he is willing to do anything, even sleep with the casting director for the part. Carey meets Gigi and they become enemies.  They put their hate for each other in the media, while Carey's friend Arthur is trying to keep his dark secret, a secret.  Philip Morey is a talented, handsome and wonderful actor with a special mind. He follows the media reports about the Gigi/Carey fight. Philip wants to be part of it, so he can get media attention.  Philip falls in love with Carey as he watches all his movies and television interviews.  He wants he him because he believes Carey is retarded. Philip decides to finance a drama film and have Carey as the lead.  As he makes his moves on Carey, he doesn't understand why Carey speaks funny and why Carey doesn't believe London and UK two are separate countries.  While on the set, Peter Right who is a veteran former drug addicted actor with demons of his own joins the cast and Gigi becomes the script editor. As their paths cross and the drama starts.   The fights and accusations are in the media, the four them are in war with each other as their dark secrets are surfacing in the media.  As the fights and hate comes to a boiling point, Philip is stabbed in the back.  He knows who did it, but he won't tell.  Of course not, he's eating up the attention as Gigi is in jail, Carey becomes an outcast wanting to die and Peter's wife thinks he is a cheater and using drugs again.  But, there is a catch.  Philip, in his special mind of wisdom decided to pay someone to destroy the lives of Gigi, Carey and Peter, and he stabbed himself in the back.  As the truth comes out, Philip is arrested and sent to a mental hospital due to his strange behavior.  He was talking on a cell phone that is not connected to service, he was paying a so-called hit man in monopoly money and talking to his dead mother as if she was still alive.  In the end, Gigi have to start from the bottom and is falling in love with Carey.  Carey has a strong affection for Gigi but his dark secrets makes it hard for him to fall in love with anyone. Peter begins to repair his marriage and family, but doesn't know if he should. Philip is let out of the mental hospital and ready to reign again.  Gigi is not finish with the media.  She can't fail.  Failure is not an option.  With help, she managed to get back on top with vengeance and willing to expose all the dark secrets of the three actors, but is conflicted over the love she has for Carey.  The lives of four people working in Hollywood provides the drama, satire, thriller, suspense and attempt murder in this 78,215 word novel called ""The Aces"". Part of the book is featured on a blog.  I have written a script as well.    I know you will love my book because it has energy, romance, thriller, suspense, drama and it's hilarious.  My favorite character is Philip because he believes that he is the most intelligent person in the world, but he is short sighted.  His life is humous and he thinks he is a serious person.  I love him because don't know what he will say or do next.    My legal name is Naeemah Small but I write under the name Aliya Leigh. I have a series of talents. I am a novelist, scriptwriter, animator, host my own podcast, voice over actress and business woman.  I specializes in psychological horror, thriller, drama and comedy.   I am quirky type of person who gets along with anyone.  I try to take up causes in my own spare time. I am loving reading about history and horror.  I am married to a beautiful woman who is a poker player.  I love life and love living.  I enjoy reading, playing video games, blogging and social media.  I speak Japanese as a second language due to my love of Japanese anime.   There have always been more opportunities to explore, more obstacles to overcome and so many more ways to beat myself at my own game. I want you to guide me and to give me strength.

Do you know why diversity is good for business?    Diversity in the workplace needs to be viewed as a competitive advantage and a business opportunity. For those who perceive diversity as exclusively a moral imperative or societal goal are missing the larger point. 925HIRE makes diversity a business priority and strives to achieve a fully inclusive diverse workforce.    Defining Diversity    Diversity is about recognizing, respecting and valuing differences based on ethnicity, gender, color, age, race, religion, disability, national origin and sexual orientation. It also includes an infinite range of individual unique characteristics and experiences, such as communication style, career path, life experience, educational background, geographic location, income level, marital status, military experience, parental status and other variables that influence personal perspectives.    These life experiences and personal perspectives make us react and think differently, approach challenges and solve problems differently, make suggestions and decisions differently, and see different opportunities. Diversity, then, is also about diversity of thought. And superior business performance requires tapping into these unique perspectives.    Diverse Workforce    As our U.S. and global customer base becomes steadily more diverse, 925HIRE's growth comes from accessing these diverse markets. It is our goal to establish long lasting and strong business relationships with our clients and candidates. Therefore we must understand our clients' diverse cultures and decision processes.    To do so, we must begin with a diverse workplace.    It is well-proven that diversity is GREAT for business, heterogeneous teams promote creativity, innovation and product development. By fully embracing diversity and maximizing the well-being and contributions of our people we strengthen the competitiveness of our company. We encourage individuals to reach their full potential, in pursuit of organizational objectives, by capitalizing on our differences.    Demographics    The faces of clients, producers, employees and suppliers have been transformed into a dynamic mix of people comprised of various races, cultures and backgrounds. In 2008, “minorities” are roughly one-third of the U.S. Population, by 2042 “minorities” will be the majority.    The population in the United States -- and globally -- is forever changing. Forward-looking companies that recognize and understand the implications of these demographic shifts are altering their client focus, employee base and business practices to better manage the needs of current and future consumer base and employees.     Buying Power    If we disregard the changing demographics, we also disregard the substantial growth in buying power of diverse markets. These diverse minority groups are an increasing percentage of the population of the United States and also in the buying power they brandish.    During the time span of 1990 to 2007, minority group market share and purchasing power doubled and in some cases tripled. By 2013, that buying power will increase by another 30%. This economic clout is not limited to minorities but also other marginalized groups. Gay and Lesbian consumers control a 6.4% market share, or $835 billion. The present and future monetary power of diverse markets is more apparent each year.    Business Imperative    In order for 925HIRE to remain competitive for talent and for our clients, it is imperative that we attract and value diverse talent and enable that talent to attract and value diverse customers. Bottom line, diversity is good for business.    Ready to take your business to the next level? Reach a global audience? It starts with your talent in the workplace and 925HIRE can help.     925HIRE, LLC, (9 to 5) is a Female, African American, Latino owned, LGBT Certified, full service staffing firm dedicated to an equitable workplace. We specialize in building culturally diverse expert staffing and training solutions throughout the United States.  We create partnerships with clients who are progressive in building and maintaining a culturally diverse workplace and recognize that being competitive in the global marketplace requires full utilization of the individual skills and talents of all employees.    We wish you continued success in your endeavors.    Be Awesome!    Tonie Snell, JobMingler  330.271.0670",INBOX

I will change it.  I am looking for distributing and also funding.      About Mercy Me  ---    “Mercy Me” is an animated short web series about a drug and sex addicted medical doctor who practice enthusiasm for a fee, created by Aliya Leigh.  Medicine is a deadly profession when a New York born, Italian-American Catholic Dr. Mercy Bachachille is around. Why? She is the Dr. Death, who is most sought out after that anyone will pay the maximum for her special sauce and to live in her wild apple bottom shoes.    After Dr. Mercy Bachachille performed an assisted suicide on her grandmother, Mercy has been re-thinking her medical practice and her own morals. Her racist drug dealing Island maid named Rasta, the ghost of her best friend Chris, her booty call Dr. O and The Devil himself are her only friends.    “Mercy Me” takes you into the world of a medical doctor who is conflicted with her practice and morals, but has the hungry for power and wealth. “Mercy Me” puts humor, drama and passion in a social issue, which conflicts morals and religious dogma.    The Story of Mercy Me is:    I believe in assisted suicide. I believe it’s my right to end my life with dignity, if I am terminally ill with no hope of recovering. I do not want to deteriorate into nothing. I want the right to end my life because it is my right to make.    “Mercy Me” is based on the death of my grandmother. My grandmother was a vibrated person who traveled and enjoyed the riches of life. She could shop until she dropped, had an elite fashion sense, business minded, charisma, colorful person.    Due to a series of afflictions with her health, grandmother found herself wasting away into skin and bones. As she felt helpless in her bed knowing she was about to die in matter of days, she asked for a quick death on her terms with dignity and respect.    In her final moments, I had the opportunity to talk to grandmother for the last time.  As I spoke to my grandmother, “I told her to get on her plane to fly away with all of her brothers, her mother and father, and best friend. I told her to enjoy the trip and never look back. I reminded her to order a big meal and a nice cold beer for the trip.”    30 minutes later, her spirit passed into the next world. It was the most painful experience I have even done and it still haunts me down to this day. When I hung up the phone, she died in a peaceful breath.    After my painful experience, I wrote script about a medical doctor who practices mercy killings as a profession. I sent the script to Chauna Mae, who is a talented and well-known actress in the southwest. She loved the script and subject matter.  She is the motivator of the show “Mercy Me”.    ---------    The next episode with deal with child sexual abuse. It didn't happen to me, but an ex-friend of mine went to jail for abusing his best friend's daughter.      The web-show has gotten buzz.  It is on IMDB, as well.          ",INBOX

Knowing her purpose in this world, knowing her true existence – her goal is to die a happy and perfect death.      The show cost me 100.00 to create and it was nominated in the UK.

I believe, you will be interested.     ---------  Sometimes things land in our lap and we do not why, but we use the opportunity to our advantage.     We begin to ask ourselves, why do I exist?  What is my purpose in life?  What is my heart’s desire?  What is my passion? Do I believe in me?    “Mercy Me Deadly Profession” takes you through the journey of an independent, strong willed, successful medical doctor who is trying to find her purpose in life through the strangest of events and friends who do not exist.      Dr. Mercy Bachachille has influence over the sick, the old, the suffering, and the weak.  She has the power over the wicked.  Her skill in medicine makes her the most sort after doctor in the world, but she lost her path, her passion, and the meaning of her existence.    She needs to find it before she it’s too late.  Knowing her purpose in this world, knowing her true existence – her goal is to die a happy and perfect death.    I can send you over the newest script for your review.

I’ve just read your profile and it looks like we share a lot of enthusiasm for what we do and who we serve.    The company I work for is Reed Art & Imaging, and we specialize in professional photo printing and fine art printing/reproduction and have done so for over 36 years (you can check out our website at http://www.reedphoto.com/). We have a mounting product we are calling the “Gallery Mount Collection” that is incredibly popular with our local photographers, studios and interior decorators. I am finding however that not many people around the country know about this beautiful and less expensive alternative to traditional framing.     A link to a video that does a much better job of describing it than I can is located here:    http://www.reedphoto.com/gallery-mount-opinion-landing/     Do you mind if I ask you a couple questions?     I’m curious about the following:    1. Have you seen this type of mounting done before?    2. Do you offer it as an option to your clients? If so, how do they like it?     3. If you haven't seen this mounting before, I would love to find out if we could help you offer this to your customers as a “value add” to your customers (and an extra revenue stream back to you.)    If you are interested in working with Reed Art & Imaging, I can offer you dealer rates and free shipping options. I can also send you samples so you can see the quality for yourself.     If you could respond back and let me know that would be greatly appreciated!     I look forward to helping you deliver the absolute best to your clients!

I have developed an anime web series, “Mercy Me Deadly Profession”, but I believe it can be a live action television series.  The show falls in the category of Weeds and Dexter, but with medical edge to it.     Actually, “Mercy Me Deadly Profession” can be both. I can still create the animation for web advertisement and for the anime fans. The web series has a list of products which people are interested in.      “Mercy Me Deadly Profession”, was nominated for an award in the UK.      Please give me an opportunity, so I can prove my worth.  Not only I can come up with ideas for television development, but I would like the opportunity to work for Sony Pictures and Television.      But, if the show does go into development, Sony will be cutting-edge, by taking a chance on an unknown person in media, will position Sony as an innovator and pioneer in inquiring great ideas.      What I can bring to Sony:     I have overseen successful aggressive marketing campaigns and branding products using social media, podcasting, radio, print, and video.  I have created successful business plans and models for companies to achieve success.  I have worked on multi-million dollars marketing budgets.  Using my communication skills, I have successfully maintained close client relationships and provided the best customer service to achieve the company’s success.    Congratulations on your marriage to your husband. I live in Arizona, so gay marriage is ban.  One day, I will legally marry my wife who is a profession poker player.      I appreciate you reading my letter and I look forward to hear from you.      Thank you for your time.

They want me to use it now for connections.     “Mercy Me” is an animated short web series about a drug and sex addicted medical doctor who practice enthusiasm for a fee.     Medicine is a deadly profession when a New York born, Italian-American Catholic Dr. Mercy Bachachille is around. Why? She is the Dr. Death, who is most sought out after that anyone will pay the maximum for her special sauce and to live in her wild apple bottom shoes.    Dr. Mercy Bachachille is a Catholic Italian-American New Yorker, who was raised in a middle-class in Long Beach with her normal insane love sick big family.      As a young child, she realized a medicine career can lead to riches           and a god-like life. The goal was to be a Plastic Surgeon, but after her performing an assisted suicide on one of her patients at a New York City Hospice when the patient wife asked for it, while she was in Medical School. At first, she did not want to participate in the act, but after a humble and crying request from the patient’s wife, Mercy gave birth to the most lucrative and sought after underground practice before graduated from Medical School with honors.    During a medical retreat in a Hawaiian paradise retreat, Mercy met her booty call and partner crime named Dr. O, who is a well-known foot fetish Podiatrist. He helps Mercy with referrals and disproving her reputation as a wild sex and drug craved doctor in all the medical circles.    After performing an assisted suicide on her grandmother, Mercy has been re-thinking her medical practice and her own morals.  Her racist drug dealing Island maid named Rasta, the ghost of her best friend Chris, her booty call Dr. O and The Devil himself are her only friends.     “Mercy Me” takes you into the world of a medical doctor who is conflicted with her practice and morals, but has the hungry for power and wealth.      “Mercy Me” puts humor, drama and passion in a social issue, which conflicts morals and religious dogma.     “Mercy Me” is a green friendly and cost effective production. The show is short and animated. The cast and crew are able to work at home by using their own equipment and resources.  The cast and crew communicate through phone, web, emails, Facebook and in person.        BTW,  Gary is still insane.         ",INBOX

Do you own a business? <<  Yes and No. It depends on your definition of ""business"" :-).  I'm registered here in Malta with my photography as a freelance business. All those years before, I could utilize aviation to do my photography parallel to it. All I had to do is to grab a standby ticket and go around the globe wherever and whenever I wanted. I could pick and chose my targets and do spec. Those times are over now and Europe with its EU is quite different compared with the States. Red tapes are literally omnipresent everywhere,       I've a VAT number for my registered freelance photo biz, but are currently exempt from VAT because I haven't reached Malta's mandatory limit for a full size biz yet.  That allows me to run my accounting still with a Profit & Loss sheet instead with a full blown accounting software.  So, I do have a business from that point of view.      However, it's still too small to consider it a business on a U.S. level :-).  I do think global but still act more local.  That may change in future so. In my opinion the e-publishing world has currently a better future than photography.  Maybe both can be combined to a successful biz with either self-publishing of non-fiction or as a service biz that offers proofreading, book cover design, etc.!  I think I have to watch the market closely and go step by step. I'll start as a self-publisher first. European rules need to be adhered in my case as well :-(.    Let's stay in touch and see where it's heading in the future. Currently, it's too early to look for a partner.  Would be nice to grow that large.    Hans    ",INBOX

Although my profile shows photography exclusively, I always had 2 careers in my life.  I just had to decide which way to make more public. I decided in favor of imaging, as I was involved in full time photography upon our return to Europe.   However, the other side of my career is highly technical.  I was in aviation, and specialized in avionics for many years. I held licenses as an avionics engineer for commercial aircraft types (Boeing and Airbus), federal licenses as a Quality Control inspector, and accepted a job as an avionics instructor for a U.S. domestic airline later on.  So I can relate to your 'techi' fields :-).  The technical publishing of maintenance training manuals for the classroom brought me recently back to my roots of PDF publishing and I'm mulling over the decision to go more into e-publishing than photography.  The latter is way to crowded with newbies anyway and the prices for images go only further down in the future.  That's why we have a common connection in LinkEds & writers. I might go and combine both capabilities (imaging & writing) to a new business start.  It's time to take stock of the situation and to decide which way to go.  Times change, so does the overall situation, and it seems that I'm on a crossroad.   Hans P.S. Your profile is quite impressive :-).",INBOX

I though I had.  I was the Data Center Manager at the Cotton Fields location on 48th street.  Needler was my Manager.  When Bert Odinet and his guy from Indonesia met me I knew my days were numbered.  I had had many conversations with the main guy from Indonesia and he didn't realize I was black as soon as he saw me he never had anything else to say to me.     I think all of the Black Managers were gone after I got canned - Even the black VP left.      ,INBOX

As you may know, I have been in the business of helping indivduals, families, and businees owners plan and execute financial strategies for over a decade now. These plans range from life insurance for protection, long term care coverage for ""what happens when"", to creation of tax free retirement income, funding buyouts, and legacy planning.     I am writing to you to see if you would be willing to sit down with me for 15 minutes or so just to explore if I can be of help to you or your family. If I can - great. And if not, at least we got a chance to catch up with each other. Either way the coffee is on me!   Would you have some time in the next two weeks to meet? Let me know a day and time and we can find a spot.   Thanks   Glen Gabrielson",INBOX

As you can probably see from my LindedIn profile, I am stuck in Hereford TX (Panhandle and beef capital of the nation) not something I am happy to tell people about.  I accepted this position out of desperation, so I wouldn't wind up being unemployed like so many of my HR colleagues who have been out of work for over a year.  I work for Caviness Meat packing (slaughter and pack Co.) and I hate it totally.  I am Puerto Rican so my Spanish is very different from the dialect spoken here, yet I get by very well.  I am very out going, pragmatic and down to earth, so I have been totally accepted by hourly and management employes.  I just don't like it here (feels like I'm living in the witness protection program).  Do you know Queenie Mack or Clarence Harrington?  They are my best friends.  My grandfather was black, so I grew up in a mixed family.  Born in NJ I still have an eastern accent and every time I talk out here people look at me like I am from a different planet.  I am driving to Phoenix for Thanksgiving and would like to offer to take you out to dinner at the resturant of your choice for all the kind endorsements you have given me.

Here's some information about me:    Greatest achievements  Random House  Created, designed, animated and produced a movie trailer for the “Shadow Creatures” blog.  I decided to produce an advertisement video for my supernatural horror blog entitled “Shadow Creatures”.  The movie trailer caught the attention of Random House.  I was able to travel to New York and meet with the VP of book development.  I talked to them about how they can improve book advertisements.     Connecting to Adult Swim  I have corresponds with Keith Crofford who is the VP of Adult Swim.    Host a social media event in Detroit, Michigan  I had an opportunity to host and conduct a social media seminar.  It was a 45 minutes question and answer seminar dealing with the importance of social media in the marketing world. The event was sponsored by the National Writer's Union.    Getting sponsors for Lesbian Life  I was able to acquire and secure sponsors, such as, “Adam & Eve”, “Netflix”, “Amazon”, “Dollhouse” and Non-profits. “Lesbian Life” had 700,000 downloads a day.  The podcast was based on my life as a Native American & Black  Republican Lesbian who loved to party around town.      Being featured in an Magazine   I was featured in “Echo” magazine.

Currently, I am an Executive Producer for an anime web show title ""Mercy Me - Deadly Profession"". ""Mercy Me – Deadly Profession"" is a dramedy about a sex and drug addicted medical doctor who practices euthanasia for a fee. ""Mercy Me – Deadly Profession"" has a small crew with a few cast members and most of the project is my responsibility. We openly communicate through Facebook since the cast and crew live in different states and towns. I am looking for a network to help develop and distribute the show.      On Facebook, I am able to outline the timetable for the editors and actors. When they receive the script, the timetable has started. In the timetable, I have scheduled for animation, extra research, redo of lines, marketing, audio editing, video editing and technical difficulties.      At DBL Distributing; which is a consumer electronic distributing, I had to create an infrastructure that was flexible enough to accommodate the timetables of 3 separate departments (Purchasing, Merchandising and Production) working in tandem. The process had to be robust enough deal with the rigors of catalog and the mundane task of producing flyers, and is easy to transition to any cyber medium.       I had to take into consideration the production schedule. I have to break the catalog down into categories and then by page. This usually resulted in some 3000 or more pages, which need to be tracked as work progresses. To make things easier I create folders for each page to accommodate the growing amount of data associated with each page. I ensure that the Buyers in the Purchasing get the pages based on their category first buy contacting the point person in Purchasing. Once the Buyers add the products to the pages the folders are assigned to the corresponding Merchandiser associated with the product categories. The Merchandiser eventually adds additional information and this is brought back to me. Once I get the pages, I QC the data to ensure that the correct information is given out to the Artist in Production. Now that the Artist has the page; Merchandiser and Artist will work on the page until the Manager of Merchandising and the Vice President of Production signs off on them.     With the process I developed, I was able to make sure the project got done in a timely manner; passed quality control and was uploaded to the publisher for print.     In addition to my other duties, I managed image acquisition for the catalog and other mediums. I assist the Vice President of Marketing, as well as the Purchasing department by building up relationships with vendors and electronic companies who sell their products through our company.                I have strong communication skills allow me to liaise fluidly among diverse stakeholders, ensuring project success and maintaining budget, deadlines and strategic priorities. Possess organizational, budgeting, problem solving, negotiation, influence, leadership and team building skills. I have a clear understanding of life cycles, phases and project management processes using Agile and MS Project. I have used Access databases to export data into Excel.      As a leader, I have a clear understanding of problem solving, project deadlines and maintaining guidelines of positive work flows which benefits the team and organization. I have a clear understanding of Risk Planning and Analysis, and take accountability of each project.       I have overseen successful aggressive marketing campaigns and branding products using social media, podcasting, radio, print and video.  I have created successful business plans and models for companies to achieve success. I have worked on multi-million dollars marketing budgets. Using my communication skills, I have successfully maintained close client relationships and provided the best customer service to achieve the company’s success.      My greatest accomplishments are my anime show ""Mercy Me"", my podcast which got 700,000 downloads a day called ""Lesbian Life"" (About my life as a Black/Native, Lesbian, Republican.  I know crazy but true.  I made fun of Republicans and other parties), created an animated book trailer for Random House (I got invited to Random House and talked to the staff about my animation skills) and fulfilling most of my dreams.     I am a team player and I am willing to relocate.    I have done work in animation.  I work under the name Aliya Leigh.      Here are samples of my work:      ""Shadow Creatures"" - http://www.imdb.com/video/demo_reel/vi467639321/  ""Mercy Me - Deadly Profession"" -http://drmercyb.wordpress.com      I would like to speak to you about my skill sets and my passion for television.

I consistently improved revenues and my customer base, and each of my businesses remained profitable for a respectable number of years until they were sold or merged with other businesses.  I am accustomed to working on my own with little direction and have developed the self-discipline.       I am accustomed to successfully juggling multiple projects and have an excellent track record of project management, technical writing, business statistics and business modeling with Agile, public speaking in front of an audience, forging strong relationships with clients, developing partnerships and increasing company revenue through innovative and creative strategies. I believe the major contributor to this success is my talent as a persuasive communicator; someone who can speak to clients.    I work equally well in team-oriented and self-directed environments and find the challenges of the start-up setting stimulating. In addition to my experience and energy, I bring to the position an extensive knowledge of trends that will make a valuable contribution towards your company’s goals.    I am familiar with most hardware and operating systems and am proficient in many business software applications and productivity tools as outlined on the enclosed résumé.   I have worked extensively with SQL, HTML, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and PhotoShop and consider myself highly proficient with these applications.       I believe I have the skills and abilities to do an excellent job marketing your software product.  I would appreciate an opportunity to interview for the position where I could discuss my ideas in more detail.  I have attached a résumé, which details my specific accomplishments.      Thank you for your time and consideration and I hope to be hearing from you in the near future.     Sincerely,   Naeemah Small  http://www.linkedin.com/in/naeemahsmall",INBOX

You mention my name Aliya Leigh. They are like a sisterhood networking group for black lesbians. It was a honor for me to get into the group and living in Arizona. The woman who started it, is picky about who she brings into the group but it is so worth it.    I work under the name Aliya Leigh. My company and I are a member of ASCAP. Some of my family is BMI.   Since you are with ASCAP, check out Harry Fox.  Harry Fox is a licensing company for artists.   What comes around, goes around - with that in mind, I always give everyone credit for work they have done. I make it a point, if anyone works with me, I will help them as much as I can.   I am looking to form partnerships and friendships.   I am working on my project now, ""Mercy Me"". It is an animation project. I am looking for partnerships for that.    You go to:  Http://www.imdb.me/aliyaleigh  Http://drmercyb.wordpress.com  Http://www.libsyn.com/aliyaleighlive  I am all over the net.

I've co-written and produced many major projects in the industry.  When you are dealing with major companies often times you are not given proper credit for your work. I plan to use that to my advantage.  Looking to form partnerships. I would need to see some of your work.  What are you looking for? Do you have links to your work?

I consistently improved revenues and my customer base, and each of my businesses remained profitable for a respectable number of years until they were sold or merged with other businesses.

I have successfully marketed my two fiction books entitled, “Mystery by Aliya Leigh” and “How to Make It in Hollywood by Aliya Leigh” and an animated internet web show entitled, “Mercy Me” through social marketing and events with a $200.00 budget.  I have obtained recognition in these areas. I have been successful in marketing other artists through Tarrah Pr; which is a public relations firm in California and New York. I have marketed other companies, products and ideas successfully through social marketing and tradition marketing. If I can obtain recognition in social marketing using a $200.00 budget, I can help your company achieve greatness.      I am willing relocate, travel and work from home.    Thank you for your time.     Naeemah Small   520-405-2724",INBOX

But could these changes could mean that profits are draining from your company if you overlook how profitability is impacted by customer payment choice?From a credit, receivables and collections perspective, how a customer pays and related expenses to support customer payments impacts your bottom line. We&rsquo;ve heard from many large and small companies that struggle with weaning customers away from checks and at the same time are concerned about paying too much for receiving card payments.For procurement, payables and treasury, optimizing payment choice helps maximize cash flow and availability, captures all available discounts and reduces operational costs for making payments. For example, there are many companies that send international payments by wire, which can cost $25-$35, instead of using an International ACH Transaction (IAT), which is much cheaper.&nbsp; Even crazier, the majority of companies continue to make check payments, which are costly and more prone to fraud as well.PAYMENTS 2018, a premier event for companies seeking to better understand payments, is a great opportunity to reevaluate your payments strategy so you don&rsquo;t fall victim to missed opportunities and savings, and unnecessary complexities.I want to personally invite you to join me April 29-May 2 in San Diego for PAYMENTS 2018 to learn from the experts how to master payments and improve company profitability. And as a business, your registration fee to the event is waived. (No kidding.)
